            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist born in 1955, is universally recognized as the inventor of the World Wide Web. His creation forever changed the way humans communicate, access information, and share knowledge. By connecting hypertext with the internet, Berners-Lee developed a revolutionary system that allows billions of users to interact across the globe. With the World Wide Web, information became decentralized and accessible to everyone with an internet connection, breaking down barriers to knowledge and democratizing access to information.</p>
            <p>In a world where access to knowledge was often limited by geographical and institutional boundaries, the web brought the concept of the “global village” to life. It connected universities, research institutions, businesses, and eventually individuals. This innovation has paved the way for the digital economy, modern communication systems, and an interconnected society.</p>

            <h2>Early Life & Education</h2>
            <p>Born in London, Tim Berners-Lee grew up in a household of innovators. His parents, Conway Berners-Lee and Mary Lee Woods, were both mathematicians and worked on the first commercially available computer, the Ferranti Mark 1. This environment of creativity and technological innovation fostered Berners-Lee’s passion for computing from a young age.</p>
            <p>Berners-Lee attended Queen's College at Oxford University, where he pursued a degree in physics. While studying at Oxford, he built his first computer using a soldering iron, TTL gates, and an old television set. His interest in how computers could process and organize information started to take shape during these years. After graduating in 1976, Berners-Lee worked in various roles, including as a software engineer, which further refined his understanding of computing systems and networking.</p>

            <h2>The Invention of the World Wide Web</h2>
                <p>In 1989, while working as a contractor at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), Berners-Lee proposed a project that would change the world: a system to enable information sharing between researchers via a network of hyperlinked documents. This system became the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee envisioned a “web” of information that users could navigate through hyperlinks, using a browser to view documents on the internet. His invention was built upon technologies that already existed, but it was his unique vision that brought them together in a revolutionary way.</p>
                <p>By 1990, Berners-Lee had developed the first web browser, known as WorldWideWeb, along with the first web server. In December 1990, the first web page was put online, explaining the project. By 1991, the World Wide Web was available to researchers across the globe. Berners-Lee’s insistence that the web be an open, non-proprietary platform has been a critical factor in its widespread adoption and growth. He ensured that anyone could use the underlying technology without having to pay royalties or obtain permission, fostering innovation and collaboration.</p>

        <section id="technologies" class="section">
            <h2>Key Technologies: HTML, HTTP, and URLs</h2>
            <p>The World Wide Web relies on three key technologies, all invented by Tim Berners-Lee:</p>
            <p><strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</strong> HTML is the language used to structure and format content on the web. It allows the integration of text, images, and multimedia in web pages and supports hyperlinks, which enable users to navigate from one document to another with ease.</p>
            <p><strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):</strong> HTTP is the protocol that governs how data is transferred between web browsers and servers. It defines the rules for exchanging data, ensuring that users can retrieve documents from anywhere in the world and display them on their screens.</p>
            <p><strong>URLs (Uniform Resource Locators):</strong> URLs are the addresses used to locate specific resources on the web. A URL is what you type into your browser's address bar to visit a specific website, making it easy to find and share content on the internet.</p>
            <p>Together, these technologies created the framework for the web, providing a standardized method for users to access and share information across the globe.</p>

        <section id="w3c" class="section">
            <h2>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</h2>
            <p>In 1994, Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an organization dedicated to developing open standards for the web. The W3C ensures that the web remains accessible and interoperable for all users, regardless of what devices or software they use. It also works to make the web accessible to people with disabilities, ensuring that everyone can benefit from the wealth of information available online.</p>
            <p>One of the key goals of the W3C is to promote the continued evolution of the web while maintaining its openness and universality. Over the years, the W3C has developed standards for technologies like HTML5, CSS, and XML, all of which have helped shape the modern web. Berners-Lee remains the director of the W3C, continuing his work to keep the web a free and open platform for innovation, communication, and commerce.</p>

            <h2>Awards & Recognition</h2>
            <p>For his groundbreaking contributions to the development of the web, Tim Berners-Lee has been recognized with numerous prestigious awards and honors, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The **Turing Award** (2016), often referred to as the "Nobel Prize of Computing," for his invention of the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms that allow the web to scale.</li>
                <li>**Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE)** (2004), awarded for his service to the global development of the internet.</li>
